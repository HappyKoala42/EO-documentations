      <p>Eclipse Origins is an open source engine which can be used to easily create an MMORPG. No coding is necessary, however, to add unique features to your game, you must know VB6. If you don’t know vb6, then you can download a custom engine pre-loaded
        with features. It is highly recommended to find an engine that is being actively supported and developed; not all engines on the site are developed and/or supported anymore. Download the Engine, uncompress it, install the Runtimes, and make your
        game. You can see the supported engines by going to the Downloads Page. You will also find the Runtimes file by clicking Step 2.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are many versions of eclipse available.</li>
        <li>They all are similiar, such as setting up the server.</li>
        <li>Each engine has its own features and limitations. Be sure to choose the engine that's right for you!</li>
        <li>No programming knowledge is required however preferred</li>
        <li>You will need Visual Basic 6 to edit the source code of these engines</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Eclipse Renewal</h3>
      <p>First you will want to download ER and install the runtimes. After that, you need to start the server. While that loads, you can open the client. As soon as the server is loaded, you can register your account. Note: do not use a password you use
        for anything else when registering. Some engines have a small tutorial world for you to learn some of the basics or new features from recent updates, and some engines do not, so don’t be surprised if you see a nice map or a black screen. Now that
        you’re logged in, you will need to switch to the server window and click the <code>Players tab</code>. Find your character’s name and right click it. You will see various options, select Make <code>Admin -> Owner.</code> Switch back to the client
        window and press <code>Insert</code> on your keyboard. This will open the <code>Admin Panel</code> and start you using the engine.</p>

      <h4>Andur Engine</h4>
      <p>Andur has a similar process to this, but the first part is quite different. First you will want to download Andur and install the runtimes. After that, you need to start the AE Launcher.</p>

      <p class="img-caption">Screensot of AE's Project manager</p>

      <p>You should see this screen. Click <code>New Project</code> and select the core folder from the Andur folder.</p>

      <p>Next, you will want to select the folder you want to save your project in. This can be any folder, just make sure you can find it. After this, you will click <code>Make</code> and wait for the copy to finish.</p>

      <p>Once this initial setup is complete, go to the folder you copied AE to and start the server. As soon as the server is loaded, you can register your account. Note: do not use a password you use for anything else when registering. Some engines have
        a small tutorial world for you to learn some of the basics or new features from recent updates, and some engines do not, so don’t be surprised if you see a nice map or a black screen.</p>

      <p>Now that you’re logged in, you will need to switch to the server window and click the <code>Players tab.</code> Find your character’s name and right click it. You will see various options, select <code>Make Admin.</code></p>

      <p>Now close the Client and open the <code>Dev Suite.</code> Once you log in, you will see a menu bar at the top of the <code>Dev Suite</code> with all the editors and options for you to use.</p>
